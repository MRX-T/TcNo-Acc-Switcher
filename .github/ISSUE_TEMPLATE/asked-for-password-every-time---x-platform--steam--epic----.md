Before you open an issue, please make sure this is actually an issue. What do I mean?
Being asked for a password every time you switch is likely user error, or something on your computer that is otherwise causing this issue. If a platform has updated, causing this error, it will be widespread.

1. Check the [Wiki - I need to enter a password every time I switch](https://github.com/TcNobo/TcNo-Acc-Switcher/wiki/FAQ---More-Info#i-need-to-enter-a-password-every-time-i-switch) for solutions on what could be going wrong.
2. If the above article was no use to you, and you're still experiencing an issue, you can open an issue. However, if this issue is not widespread, and caused by an update: It is more than likely A. Your computer, software running on it or its configuration. B. A configuration error or unique issue that affects the TcNo Account Switcher. Or C. User-error.

I will assist to the best of my ability, but if the issue isn't widespread it's not something I can easily solve most of the time - **I assume you have already tried the steps mentioned in the FAQ before opening an issue**, so PLEASE make sure you have. 

If you have followed the FAQ above, you may open an issue on this topic. Please make sure to include as much relevant information as possible to help speed up the process. I will likely ask for more info, so make sure to check your email, or this page once in a while for updates.
